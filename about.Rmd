<font size="5"> 
The MBON Pole to Pole effort seeks to develop a framework for the collection, use and sharing of marine biodiversity data in a coordinated, standardized manner leveraging on existing infrastructure managed by the Global Ocean Observing System ([GOOS](http://www.goosocean.org/){target="_blank"}; IOC-UNESCO), the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network ([GEO BON](https://geobon.org/){target="_blank"}), and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System ([OBIS](http://iobis.org/){target="_blank"}). The MBON Pole to Pole aims to become a key resource for decision-making and management of living resources across countries in the Americas for reporting requirements under the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), Aichi Targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
