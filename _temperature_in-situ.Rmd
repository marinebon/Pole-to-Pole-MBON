### Temperature, _In situ_

```{r, eval=has_temp_insitu}
# output timeseries plot
p <- plot_insitutemp(temp_csv, meta_yml)
m <- attr(p, "meta")
p
```

This timeseries was created using data collected by `r m$num_loggers` biomimetic temperature loggers between `r m$day_min` and `r m$day_max`. Loggers were placed in the `r tolower(knitr::combine_words(m$zones))` zones of the intertidal ecosystem.
