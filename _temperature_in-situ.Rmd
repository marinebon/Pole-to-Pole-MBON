### Temperature, _In situ_

```{r, eval=has_temp_insitu}
meta <- read_yaml(meta_yml)
d    <- read_csv(temp_csv)
x    <- xts(select(d, -day), order.by = d$day)

# output timeseries plot
get_dygraph(x)
```

This timeseries was created using data collected by `r meta$num_loggers` biomimetic temperature loggers between `r min(d$day)` and `r max(d$day)`. Loggers were placed in the `r tolower(knitr::combine_words(names(x)))` zones of the intertidal ecosystem.
