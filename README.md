# p2p
Pole to Pole website

This website was built as an [R Markdown website](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html).

## Building Website

- The easiest way to generate the website is clicking on the **Build Website** menu button from the **Build** pane in RStudio after opening this repository's project by double-clicking on `p2p.Rproj`. All the content files (\*.Rmd, \*.md, \*.html) are rendered and output to the **`docs/`** folder, where it is served to [marinebon.github.io/p2p](https://marinebon.github.io/p2p) via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

- **WARNING**: Do _**NOT**_ place any content in the **`docs/`** since it gets wiped clean before rebuilding the website in its place.
